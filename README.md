# ShapeTDA: Computational Geometry and Topology for Drug Discovery

> **Ligand-Based Virtual Screening using Shape-Aware and Topological Descriptors**  


---

### Project Summary
**ShapeTDA** explores how *computational geometry* and *topological data analysis (TDA)* can enhance **ligand-based virtual screening** — the process of identifying active drug-like molecules using 3D molecular structures.  

This project introduces **shape- and topology-aware molecular descriptors**, evaluated across the **DUD-E** and **MUV** datasets with multiple ML models, to assess how geometry and topology can jointly improve early hit discovery in drug design.

---

## Overview

Traditional molecular descriptors such as **USR (Ultrafast Shape Recognition)** capture only geometric atom distributions, missing vital *connectivity* and *orientation* cues.  
This work integrates **topological data analysis (TDA)** to represent molecules as rich 3D manifolds — capturing not just *where atoms are*, but *how they are connected and arranged in space.*

### Descriptor Frameworks Implemented

| ID | Descriptor Type | Core Concept |
|----|-----------------|---------------|
| 1️ | **USR (Ultrafast Shape Recognition)** | Classical geometric descriptor based on distance distributions |
| 2️ | **Persistent Homology (H₀)** | Captures connected components (molecular fragments) |
| 3️ | **Persistent Homology (H₀ + H₁)** | Adds loop-based topology — cavities and ring structures |
| 4️ | **Directional Complex Descriptor** | Encodes *orientation-aware topology* via spatial directionality |
| 5️ | **Augmented Topological Descriptor** | Introduces rotational augmentation for robustness testing |

## Datasets

| Dataset | Targets | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **DUD-E (Directory of Useful Decoys, Enhanced)** | 8 | Diverse targets, standard benchmark for ligand–decoy discrimination |
| **MUV (Maximum Unbiased Validation)** | 17 | Harder, class-balanced dataset with realistic decoy distributions |

Each ligand and decoy was represented as a **3D point cloud**, from which shape and topological descriptors were extracted.  

---

## Machine Learning Pipeline

All descriptors were evaluated across four classifiers to benchmark generalizability:

- Logistic Regression (LR)  
- Random Forest (RF)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM, RBF Kernel)  
- XGBoost (Gradient Boosted Trees)

**Performance metrics:**
- **AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)** – overall classification quality  
- **EF% (Enrichment Factor @15%)** – early discovery efficiency, critical in screening pipelines

## Core Insights

1. **Topological Features Add Depth**  
   Persistent Homology (H₀ + H₁) introduced meaningful structure-awareness beyond geometry.

2. **Orientation Matters**  
   Directional Complex outperformed all others by encoding both **shape** and **directionality** — essential for realistic 3D molecular discrimination.

3. **Augmentation ≠ Always Improvement**  
   While it improved generalization slightly, naïve rotation augmentation introduced redundancy.
